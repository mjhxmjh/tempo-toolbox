> ### What is a note?
>
> In music, a note dictates what pitch a sound is, and how long it is held for.
> A beat is something we can use to relate to. Note values can be thought of in terms of beats.
> For example, a 'crotchet' is held for one beat and there are usually four beats to a bar, so a crotchet is also a 1/4

### Building Data Structure

// This function calculates the length of note values (in milliseconds) and frequency (in Hz) based on the bpm.
// It takes two inputs: note values array and bpm

// return a dataset that looks like:

/\*
const delayValues = [
{
noteValue: '1/8',
duration: 2400.00,
frequency: 0.1,

},
{
noteValue: '1/4t',
duration: 2400,
frequency: 0.4,
},
{
noteValue: '1/16',
duration: 400,
frequency: 0.2,
},
];
